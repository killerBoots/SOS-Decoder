# SOS-Decoder
JS String decoder 

M-dwarfs Challenge

Challange Description:

Pintu’s spaceship has crashed on M-dwarfs. He sends n sequential SOS messages to ISRO for help. But the letters in some of the SOS
messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission. Given the signal received by Earth as a string, S, determine how many 
letters of Pintu’s SOS have been changed by radiation. If the message was received without any radiation it would just have repetition of 
‘SOS’, for example “SOSSOSSOS”. But if the message is damaged by radiation, it will have other characters too, for example “SOSSPSSQSSOR”. 
So, If input is “SOSSPSSQSSOR” the answer would be “3” and if input is SOSSOS the answer would be “0”.
